This is the first try at creating a shiny app. The app uses basic physics formulae to devise a simple game of football. 

The objective of the game is to predict whether the ball kicked by you will score a goal or not. The ball is kicked with certain speed and angle and has to fly above the goalkeeper to score a goal. 

Have fun exploring different possibilities of scoring a goal!
